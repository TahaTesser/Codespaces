## setup.sh

This script will install Flutter and set up the environment for development in GitHub Codespaces.

- Install zsh if not present
- Install Oh My Zsh if not present
- Install Flutter
- Set up Flutter environment
- Disable Windows, macOS, Android, Linux and web configurations. As I'm using GitHub Codespaces only for running Flutter tests and not for development.
